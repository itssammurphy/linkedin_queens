# Contributing

Now, admittedly there isn't a whole lot of contributing that this repository needs, but there is one main thing that could help improving the repo, which is **adding archived boards**

## How to add a board

The archive of LinkedIn Queens boards is available at `boards.py` in a dictionary. Keys are `DD-MM-YYYY` format.

Fork this repository, add whatever boards you would like (so long as they are from actual LinkedIn Queens games) to the boards archive, and make a pull request, tagging it with the `board archive` label.

I will endeavour to merge these as quickly as possible after they come in (an easy way for me to help people farm GitHub contributions)
